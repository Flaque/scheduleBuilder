# Schedule Builder

This app uses Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node (MEAN). Generate all possible schedules for users based on their class selections! This project is tied to the [Schedule Builder Backend](https://github.com/tdurnford/schedule-builder-backend). We intended to redo the program once made as a Java Applet using modern web developmen technologies!
